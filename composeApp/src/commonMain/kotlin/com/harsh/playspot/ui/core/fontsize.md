*   **Large:** Large header on a Welcome/Hero screen.
*   **Medium:** Large numbers in a dashboard (e.g., "75% complete").
*   **Small:** Screen titles on high-impact landing pages.
*   **Weight Mapping:** Use `Black` or `ExtraBold` variants of Exo2.

### 2. Headline (Large, Medium, Small)
**When to use:** To mark the start of a primary section or a new page in a flow.

*   **Large:** Page titles (e.g., "Settings", "Profile").
*   **Medium:** Section headers within a long page.
*   **Small:** Headers for smaller cards or grouped content.
*   **Weight Mapping:** Use `Bold` or `SemiBold` variants of Exo2.

### 3. Title (Large, Medium, Small)
**When to use:** For secondary importance text, such as the title of a list item or a specific setting.

*   **Large:** Titles in top app bars.
